# Phase 1

In this stage, I mainly focused on getting my foundation in electronics learning about fundamentals such as diode amplifier network models to basic breadboard connection parts which I learned on YouTube and some open-source software. 

Most of my components were bought through the local store

I've been learning this by focusing my future on embedded system software.
